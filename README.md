# Venice-Boat-Classification_Deeplearning
The Venice Boat Classification project uses Deep Learning to classify different types of boats found in Venice.It aims to help automate recognition and monitoring of water transport types for smart city applications, tourism analysis, and environmental tracking.

## 🧠 Key Features
* Image classification using TensorFlow/Keras
* Data preprocessing and augmentation for better generalization
* Model evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics
* Visualization of training performance (accuracy/loss curves)
* Support for custom image prediction

## ⚙️ Steps in the Project
* Data Extraction from ZIP file
* Image Preprocessing (resize, normalize, augment)
* Model Building using CNN layers
* Model Training and Validation
*Evaluation (Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix)
*Prediction on new images

## 📂 Dataset
